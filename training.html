    <h3>Training History</h3>
    <p>My interest for IT started as a young lad. But since opportunities to
      pursue dreams are not always avaialable especially in third world countries,
      I had to resort to other professions that were more easily accessible to
      me. First I became a teacher, then a nurse. But as nature would have it,
      I was never happy doing these things. So I took the bold step to follow
      my dream. I started with network and information security, got CompTIA
      Security+ Certified but I quickly realized that space was not for me.
      During a programming fundamentals class which was required as part of my
      college coursework,
      something magical happened...i found my love! I was born to be a
      programmer!ðŸ˜€</p>
